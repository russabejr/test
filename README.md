# Homework Assignment: git

I did not work with a buddy on this assignment. I certify that this submission represents my own original work. The only collaboration I did was sharing my repository with members of my group, which was part of the assignment.

It took me less than an hour to finish this assignment.

I liked the assignment! I always wondered how people made websites using GitHub, and now I know! I am now inspired to make my own website, maybe for personal use such as a resume or something like that!

Overall impression: I liked this assignment!
